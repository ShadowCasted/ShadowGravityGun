ShadowGravityGun

A project by the ShadowCasted team:

To do list: 

- Create a way of giving a player a reconizeable item
- have interact with a block call a method such as delete the block and print out a message
- make a way to spawn an entity where ever we want (doesn't matter what type)
- create a way for an entity's position to be controlled based on where the player is looking and a given distance.
- create a way to know when the player scrolls
- create a way to cancel player scroll event (if possible)
- create a method to spawn a flying entity block (easiest)
- create a way to prevent sand/gravel from settling
- link block interact with an item to deleting the block and spawning a new one.
- fix it so the block info is stored so when its settled it has the same data (like if it was a chest it would still have items)
- link up controlling the entity with when it's created.
- create a hashmap/manager so we can tell when players have/are using this.
- should have been part of control but link when the player scrolls to increasing the blocks distance with the player based off of pitch and yaw. (I'll get some help with the math on this one)
- release
